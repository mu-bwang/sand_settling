This online calculator computes the terminal settling velocity of sand particles in quiescent water.

It solves the drag law equation through iterations using the drag coefficient calculated based on Cheng (1997).

It is used in our sedimentation model in predicting the locations where sediment cloud interacts with the streambed that may affect mussel habitat in construction related projects.
